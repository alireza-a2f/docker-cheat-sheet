# Docker Volumes Cheat Sheet

## Volume Inspection and Management
- `docker volume create my_volume`: Create a new volume by specifying a name.
- `docker volume ls`: List all volumes on the Docker host.
- `docker volume inspect my_volume`: Display detailed information on one or more volumes.
- `docker volume rm my_volume`: Remove one or more volumes. Volumes can only be removed if not in use by any containers.
- `docker volume prune`: Clean up unused volumes to free up space.
- `docker run -d -v my_volume:/path/in/container my_image`: Start a Container with a Volume.

## Best Practices

- **Persistent Data**: Use volumes for data that must persist across container restarts and removals, or for data that should be shared among multiple containers.

- **Database Storage**: Itâ€™s recommended to use volumes for database storage to ensure data persists and is performance-optimized for I/O operations.

- **Backups**: Regularly back up important data from volumes to prevent data loss. Docker does not automatically back up data in volumes.

- **Security**: Be cautious with volume permissions and data security, especially when dealing with sensitive information. Make sure only authorized containers and services have access to volumes containing sensitive data.

- **Volume Drivers**: For advanced storage needs, explore third-party volume plugins and drivers. These can provide additional features like remote data stores, encryption, or improved performance.
